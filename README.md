This is the start of a project that will feature me using new languages, databases, and frameworks.  I believe in developing in public, even if that development is just me learning new skills.

# New Skills

## Front-End
- Next.js, incorporating Tailwind and TypeScript 
    - TypeScript -> currently learning (see learningTS repo)
    - Next.js -> next to learn
    - Tailwind -> already know, but need to learn incorporating it into a Next.js project

## Back-End
- Two ideas:  Build with C#, or use Next.js full-stack features
    - If C# -> learn how to build web servers and interface with SQL using C#
    - If Next.js -> learn alongside Front-End features

## Database
- PostreSQL
    - Have used MySQL, but will need to learn the dialect and additional features
    - Can I use Sequelize as an ORM with PostgreSQL?
